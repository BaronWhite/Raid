			/* Altough this is largely my project now, I cannot forget to mention my precious colleagues that helped me develop the initial game at university. */

			// Asad Khan | Programmer
			/* Initial character development, worked long hours on an analogue controlled combat system that was too complex to fit in the game. A good friend.*/
			// Mika Hinas | Artist
			/* A good companion, modeled the lovely pirate that unfortunately glitched out a bit and ended up with elf ears, the houses and some other stuff. He also helped with the initial game idea */
			//Tess Carter | Programmer
			/* Helped with level design,menus, the shop and weapon effects stuff. Took my Tess-co jokes with a smile every single day. */
			// "The other artist"
			/* Honestly don't remember his name, but I don't think he remembers mine either. He did do a great job on designing those boats and weapons though.*/
